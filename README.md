# Bitbox
### The basic components are the File System Manager that monitors a given directory in the file system on a local machine, for changes to files, etc., and a BitBox Peer that can "relay" these changes to another BitBox Peer on a remote machine.
### We would like to allow the BitBox Peers to form an unstructured P2P network. By unstructured we mean that the connection pattern has no relevance to the functionality, and is somewhat arbitrary depending on how and when peers come and go.
